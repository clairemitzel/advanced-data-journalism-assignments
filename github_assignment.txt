I cloned the Texas Tribune's lethal drug tracker repository for their single page app that tracks how many lethal drug doses Texas has in stock. I looked through several news organizations' repositories, and this stuck out to me because it could be useful for any state that uses execution. It could probably easily be tinkered with to be relevant to Missouri.

In contrast to some repositories that only have several files or folders, this one has five folders and 12 stand-alone files. That was a bit overwhelming to look through, because they all appear to have different functions that go way over my head. I figured out what some of them have to do with because they had useful titles and descriptions â€” for example, "templates," which has to do with playing with colors and styles. That's prety self-explanatory. 

But what does "yarn" mean? Or "gulp"? It seems like a command, or maybe a description. Looking at the code, I think I understand why there are quotation marks and brackets. But what do all of these seemingly random strings of code actually do? I have no idea. I see all of this code that doesn't look like anything special, and then I look at the finished project, and it seems like there's a huge disconnect between the two. The random strings of words and numbers are clearly very powerful, if the right order can create an informative webpage. The trouble I have is that I don't know how they fit together. I'm looking forward to learning how to make the connection, though.
